# CV Application Project

Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/cv-project).

## Functionality

This is the [CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application) project, where I use React to create a site where users can click to edit fields and enter information to format their own resumes.

## Thoughts

It was really cool to finally dive more deeply into React, and make a project with some more complexity to it. Before starting, I clicked to see some of the other learners' submissions, and I realized I really liked one where you could just click on the text and have it be transformed into an input field, and then automatically saved when you click away - so I wanted to do that too, instead of having separate edit and submit buttons.

Ultimately, it wasn't that difficult. Just a matter of organizing separate things into separate components, and working no each of them individually. This composable approach made life so much easier. The whole time I worked on this, I was comparing it to the process of making my [Task App](https://github.com/harmolipi/task-app) with vanilla JS, and how much more difficult and convoluted it felt. I think it would be much easier to tackle now with React.

Additionally, this time around I also experimented with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the first time. It took some adjusting as I got a sense of what class does what, but eventually I really liked it. It seems to work well with React's use of components. I know I can refactor even more things into components to save myself from having all their classes listed multiple times (for example, with the various buttons in the application), so on a future pass I'll have to do that. In the future, I also hope to return to it and explore ways to export the finished resume. For now, if you actually want to use it, you'll need to take a screenshot. But it would be great to figure out how to export it to PDF.

What was most surprising to me, while working on this project, is that I ended up spending more time styling the app than getting it to function, which is a real testament to React. I look forward to learning more.

God bless.
